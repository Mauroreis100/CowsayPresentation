# For the Techies

## How to run this program?
After cloning the project inside the folder type on the command line:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on a Debian based distro try typing in command line before running (See what it does)
```
sudo xhost +
```
This will install the dependencies required to run all the programs

Run helloWorld.py and have fun. :)
